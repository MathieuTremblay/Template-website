								<p>Hello there! My name is <b>mathieu1406</b>, and I'm a Xweetok. We're primarily ground-dwelling Neopets, and love living in heavily forested areas. You can often find us making our home among the roots of trees or in large crevices of old trunks. Some of us prefer the city life and comfort of Neohomes, though. That's why I was so happy when <b><a href="http://www.neopets.com/randomfriend.phtml?randomfriend=mariesoleilsoucy">mariesoleilsoucy</a></b> adopted me! I really enjoy sleeping in a nice, cozy bed and sipping hot chocolate by the fireplace. Most of the time, however, you can find me outside, playing active games like tag. Us Xweetoks have very fast reflexes, so catch me if you can!</p>
